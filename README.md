# UART Transceiver Implementation on Cyclone® IV FPGA

## Project Overview

- This project involves the design, implementation, and verification of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) transceiver using Verilog RTL.
- The implementation was carried out on Cyclone® IV EP4CE22F17C6N FPGA using Quartus Prime software.

## Tasks

1. **Verilog RTL Design**: 
   - Sourced and refined a Verilog RTL code for the UART transceiver.

2. **Testbench Development**:
   - Developed a comprehensive testbench to simulate and validate the UART transceiver’s functionality.

3. **FPGA Implementation**:
   - Implemented the RTL design on the Cyclone® IV FPGA.
   - Verified the design through a practical setup involving two FPGA boards.

4. **Collaborative Verification**:
   - Collaborated with another group to test the UART transceiver by transmitting and receiving a counter or series of numbers between the two FPGA boards.
   - Confirmed the correct operation of the UART protocol through successful transmission and reception.

5. **Evaluation and Waveform Analysis**:
   - Work was evaluated by an instructor, confirming the implementation’s correctness.
   - Used an oscilloscope to capture the waveform of the transmitted data, providing visual confirmation of the UART operation.

## Tools and Technology

- **FPGA Used**: Cyclone® IV EP4CE22F17C6N FPGA
- **Software Used**: Quartus Prime for design and simulation
- **Verification Method**: Transmission and reception of numerical data between FPGA boards, analyzed using an oscilloscope.

## Outcome

- Successfully demonstrated UART communication between two FPGA boards.
- Validated the implementation through both simulation and practical testing, confirmed by oscilloscope waveform analysis.
